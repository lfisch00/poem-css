 <h1>Fall, Leaves, Fall</h1><br>
 <h2>By Emily Brontë</h2><br><br>
<p>Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;
Lengthen night and shorten day;
Every leaf speaks bliss to me
Fluttering from the autumn tree.
I shall smile when wreaths of snow
Blossom where the rose should grow;
I shall sing when night’s decay
Ushers in a drearier day.</p>
